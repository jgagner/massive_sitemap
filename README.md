Build painfree sitemaps for webpages with millions of pages

MassiveSitemap is a successor project of [BigSitemap](https://github.com/alexrabarts/big_sitemap), a [Sitemap](http://sitemaps.org) generator for webpages with millions of pages.
It implements various generation stategies, e.g. to split large Sitemaps into multiple files, gzip files to minimize bandwidth usage, or incremental updates. Its Api is very similar to _BigSitemap_ and therefor can be set up with just a few lines of code and is compatible with just about any framework.
